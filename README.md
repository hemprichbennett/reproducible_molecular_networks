# reproducible_molecular_networks
I'm beginning to think about how best to share molecular network data in a reusable and reproducible way. The data we now generate provide exciting new possibilities for data reuse and reinterpretation, but new standards are required for this to be both possible and viable.

Thoughts and ideas go here, feel free to contribute!
